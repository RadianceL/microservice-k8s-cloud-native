### What is Phoenix Server
In software engineering, as long as the time scale for the development of any product is long enough, 
people will always neglect and make mistakes, code will always carry defects, computers will always crash, 
and networks will always be blocked and interrupted

Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.â€”Nevil Maskelyne

According to Phoenix Server Philosophy - shit always happens, we believe every thing is unstable, 
but how to use those "unstable component" to assemble a stable system is what phoenix system think about
